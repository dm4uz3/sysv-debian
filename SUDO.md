# sudo

If you're completely new - once you install Debian, you'll find out that `sudo` doesn't work, unless you know how to read and haven't put in a root password.

You can either -  
* reinstall Debian  
* enable `sudo` manually  
* cry

## Enabling sudo manually

First, you need to have `sudo` installed.  
Use
```
$ su
```
to become root (use the root's password here) and install `sudo` by using  
```
# apt-get update
# apt-get install -y sudo
```
Next, you'll need to enable it, type  
```
# visudo
```
and add in
```
<username>   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
```
replace `<username>` with your username  

### Now sudo should work. And shame on you for not reading.
